					<h2>A walk through La Rambla!</h2>
					<img src="images/lasramblas1.jpg" alt="Las Ramblas" />
					<p>
						Las Ramblas is the best-known landmark in <em>Barcelona</em>. This thriving pedestrian
						thoroughfare cuts through the old town, winding down from the Plaça de Catalunya to the Columbus
						monument. The centre is filled with bustling stalls creating an open-air market with souvenir
						and newspaper kiosks, and of course the world-famous flower stalls line the pedestrian walkway.

					<h2>Barceloneta</h2>
					<img src="images/barceloneta1.jpg" alt="Barceloneta" />
					<p>
						Fishermen were naturally the first to settle during the 18th century on the seafront land now
						known as Barceloneta. Even now if you delve into the dim, narrow back streets, there is still an
						old village feel to the place, with old women shouting to one another across balconies and old
						men sitting on the street outside the door to their house. However Barceloneta now also has a
						different side, a cosmopolitan, tourist-driven life of its own, bars and cafes booming out music
						day and night.

					<h2>Things to do in El Born, Barcelona</h2>
					<img src="images/born1.jpg" alt="Born" />
					<p>
						El Born in Barcelona is more than an artistic and eclectic neighborhood, it has ties to a noble
						past. In medieval days, it became home to the aristocracy, and the center of trade due to its
						proximity to the sea which gave a name to most streets. Partially destroyed during the secession
						war in the XVIII century, it came back to the center of Barcelona´s life with a share of
						innocuous antagonism for ¨the establishment¨. El Born is a unique and historical destination
						worthy touring in Barcelona, and before you sequester yourself on other stuff, make sure you do
						these essential things to do at El Born.
